# Install

To build a *Cerebral* application you need three parts. A **state** package, a **ui** package and **cerebral** itself. What packages you choose depends on your preferences and requirements. A typical installation would be:

`$ npm install cerebral`

`$ npm install cerebral-react`

`$ npm install cerebral-baobab`

`npm install react`

`npm install react-dom`

Look at different packages using the menu and get details on how to install and use them.

### The debugger

You can install the Cerebral debugger form the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cerebral-debugger/ddefoknoniaeoikpgneklcbjlipfedbb).
